## About ChatLock

ChatLock is an innovative social media platform designed to merge the best features of Instagram, Facebook, and Telegram into a single, privacy-first experience. Our mission is to empower users with **complete control over their content**, foster **authentic engagement**, and leverage **AI-powered insights** to enrich online interactions.

## Core Features

### 🔐 LockModes — Advanced Content Control  
Enable users to precisely manage who views their posts with options like *Close Friends*, *Mutuals*, or *Timed Auto-Lock*. Unlock requests allow selective content monetization without third-party platforms.

### 🧠 AI-Powered Vibe Filter  
Before posting, an intelligent AI analyzes emotional tone — happy, sad, sarcastic, angry — and provides recommendations for mood adjustments, hashtags, and emojis, minimizing misinterpretations.

### 💬 VaultChat — Secure, Disappearing Messaging  
End-to-end encrypted chats that self-destruct after reading. Embed secret codes within images for confidential communication — perfect for privacy-conscious users and activists.

### 🎭 Persona Profiles  
Users manage up to three personas — Personal, Professional, and Artistic — each with independent audiences, styles, and privacy settings, enabling seamless role-based social networking.

### 📊 Clarity Metrics  
Move beyond vanity metrics with an Impact Score that reflects meaningful engagement — comments, saves, and interactions — delivered as insightful weekly reports.

### 🧘 SafeZone Mode  
Activate content filters to reduce exposure to toxic or stressful material, limit notifications, and apply calming themes. SafeZone encourages mindful and positive social media experiences.

### 💡 Decentralized Identity Control  
With Web3 integration, users retain full ownership of their data on decentralized networks. Easily export or permanently delete all personal information with a single click.
